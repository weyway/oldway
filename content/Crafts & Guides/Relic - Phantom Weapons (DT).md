# Lore

>Harried by circumstances financial and otherwise, Eorzea's finest weaponsmith finds himself on a treacherous journey bound for seas unknown. Yet amidst the peril is an opportunity to achieve a new pinnacle of weapon fabrication, harnessing arcane powers as potent as they are illusory...
>
>- Patch 7.2 Official Site

# Prerequisites

To start the quest chains for this set of relic weapons, there's some requirements that must be met beforehand:

- The level needed to complete this chain is **level 100** on a Disciple of War or Magic
- Completion of the Main Scenario Quest [Dawntrail](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Dawntrail_(Quest))

This relic is connected with a field operation, much like Eureka and Bozja relics before.
As such, to start the relic quests you will need to start the quests to get access to the [Occult crescent](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Occult_Crescent:_South_Horn).

Keep in mind that the information below will be subject to updates as we progress through the tiers of weapon.

For now, this information reflects what is currently out in **7.25** patch.

# Quests

>Lydirceil is on the hunt for a missing weaponsmith.
>
>- In-game description

This relic starts by talking to [Lydirceil](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Lydirceil) in the [Phantom Village](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Phantom_Village) (x:6.6 y:7.1)

After you're done finding our favourite drunk smith, you're on your way to the first steps.

Do you remember **Atma** ?
Does it make you cry?
Everyone say hi to...
## Demiatma

This first quest will have you collecting **Demiatma**,
As [Gerolt](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Gerolt) put it...

>[!quote] Sometimes a foul beastie in the throes o' death'll leave behind a crystallized chunk o' their life essence.

These items are rare drops that can be obtained in two ways - either inside the **Occult Crescent's South Horn**, or through **FATEs** in other regions.

Thankfully, this quest is a **one-time step**, 

After you're done collecting all the **Demiatmas** you will be able to complete **one** relic, so grab any rum that Gerolt hasn't put his hands on yet, and lets go!
### Required Items

Farm **FATEs** in each of the Heavensward zones to obtain crystals.
Only one crystal per zone is needed and it shouldn't be as bad as [[Relic - Zodiac Weapons (ARR)#3 - Atma|Atma]] from [[Relic - Zodiac Weapons (ARR)]].

See below where to go for each one.

#### Inside Occult Crescent

## 1.5 - Forging the Phantasmal
![[Forging_the_Phantasmal_Image.png]]

Thankfully that's done!

Now you want more relics right?.. Right?!

You will be able to redo this quest for any other relics you might want.

The subsequent completions of this quest will no longer require **Demiatma** but it will require a different item.

You will have to trade in **3 [Arcanite](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Arcanite)** for each additional relic you wish to complete.

These can be bought from [Ermina](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Ermina#vendor1) for a total cost of 1500 **tomestones** per additional relic.
